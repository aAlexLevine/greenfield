Apparently she was declawed by her previous owners, then abandoned or lost. Since she couldnt hunt, she nearly starved. Not only that, but she had an abscess on one hip. The vets at the Humane Society had drained it, but it was still scabby and without fur. She had a terrible cold, too. She was sneezing and sniffling and her meow was just a hoarse squeak. And shed lost half her tail somewhere. Instead of tapering gracefully, it had a bony knob at the end."
